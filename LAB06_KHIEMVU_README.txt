CNN BASELINE********************************
import tensor flow, datasets, layers, models, keras, matplot 

set the hyper parameters 
NOTE: large epochs and batch size will take the code longer to run

This code trains n ai model to recognize images, it takes pictures from the CIFAR website 
after this computting this code will gie an h5 file that is the brain of the ai 
this brain will try to guess what the classification of the pictures such as "cat" "dog" 
"airplane" "automobile"

NOTE: to increase accuracy, add data augmmentation, increase batch size and epochs, and define model structures. 


CNN - CHALLENGE TEST *********************************
import os, ssl, tensorflow, matplotlib, pathlib, certifi  

This code uses the h5 file create by the cnn file to determine the given imagages 
NOTE: create class names : airpanes, automobilem bird, cat ect 

This file is to load images from the certain links provide, the code will then use the h5 file 
to analyze and try to guess what the picture is. 

NOTE: make sure to insert your own h5 file: Khiem_CIFARmodel.h5 


GAME DEVELOPMENT HAPPY GARDEN********************************** 
import: pgzrun, pygame, pgzero, random, randint, actor, time 

this game implements garden game where you have to control the cow to water the plant and avoid 
the fang plants 

TWEAKS: more enemy plants, the sky is raining, and more enemies 

HELLO WORLD TO OPEN AI***************************
Hello World to OpenAI
The following program is a Funny Name Generator, that produces a fun and easy to follow program that allows users to generate 
creative and interesting names for pets, humans, or any type of species. To start the program, run the following command:

python -m venv venv
. venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
flask run



HELLO WORLD TO CHATGPT**************************
For Hello world to ChatGPT, you will need to import the ChatGPT loopquery py file which will set up OpenAIs machine learning software. 
You Will need to import the folllowing in order to get OpenAI to work properly
import os
import openai #remember to pip install pandas openai

from dotenv import load_dotenv  #remember to pip install python-dotenv
load_dotenv()

After that you will need to generate the unique API key from your OpenAI 
account in order to initiate your subscription and use of the OpenAI services

you will also need to include a .ENV file with your unique API key within it so the py file can use it to identify the API Key
